# Note: You need to download MPT3 toolbox to use the Matlab codes
# Run the tracking_mpc_cstr.ipynb first to store the closed-loop trajectories of outputs
# Then run Min_Inv_set_cstr.m to estimate the minimum invariant sets and output terminal sets
# Finally, run the comparison_plot_attack.m to plot the terminal sets and to check for the containment of outputs within the terminal set for attack-free operation. You can either plot the terminal set for the attack and attack-free operations together, or just plot the outputs of the closed-loop operation and the terminal set for theattack-free operation, or all three together. The eps-writer command is to show how trajectories are evolving with time. However, if you want to see the final results immediately, you can comment the command.
